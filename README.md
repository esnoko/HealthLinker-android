# HealthLinkers Android App

HealthLinkers is a mobile application designed to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers. The app streamlines appointment scheduling, enables secure communication, and provides users with easy access to their medical informationâ€”all from their Android device. By leveraging modern web technologies with [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) and native Android code, HealthLinkers delivers a seamless, cross-platform healthcare experience.

## Project Structure

- **app/**: Main Android application module (Java, resources, Gradle config)
- **capacitor-cordova-android-plugins/**: Cordova plugins for Capacitor integration
- **gradle/**: Gradle wrapper and related files
- **variables.gradle**: Centralized version and SDK variables
- **build.gradle**: Top-level Gradle build file
- **settings.gradle**: Project settings and module includes

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for Capacitor)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- Java 17+
- Android SDK (API 34 recommended)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - For Capacitor plugins and web assets, run (from the root of your Ionic/Capacitor project):
     ```sh
     npm install
     npx cap sync android
     ```

3. **Open in Android Studio:**
   - Open the `android/` folder in Android Studio.

4. **Build the project:**
   - Use Android Studio's build/run buttons, or from terminal:
     ```sh
     ./gradlew assembleDebug
     ```

## Running the App

- Connect an Android device or start an emulator.
- Run the app from Android Studio or with:
  ```sh
  ./gradlew installDebug
  ```

## Testing

- **Unit tests:**  
  Located in [`app/src/test/java/com/getcapacitor/myapp/ExampleUnitTest.java`](app/src/test/java/com/getcapacitor/myapp/ExampleUnitTest.java)
- **Instrumented tests:**  
  Located in [`app/src/androidTest/java/com/getcapacitor/myapp/ExampleInstrumentedTest.java`](app/src/androidTest/java/com/getcapacitor/myapp/ExampleInstrumentedTest.java)

Run tests with:
```sh
./gradlew test
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

## Notes

- Do not edit files marked as generated by Capacitor (e.g., `capacitor.settings.gradle`, `capacitor.build.gradle`).
- Place your web assets in the appropriate directory in your main Capacitor project and sync with `npx cap sync android`.
